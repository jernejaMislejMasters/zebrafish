models:



per length bout count is taken as proportion of total bout count , not adjusting for anything in the model:

glm("per length bout count"~TimeFactor+Group+TimeFactor*Group, family = quasipoisson)




turn proportion per length is adjusted for total count of bouts of length n:

glm("per length turn proportion"~TimeFactor+Group+TimeFactor*Group+"total count of length n bouts", 
			family = quasipoisson)




turn transitions per length is adjusted for total count of bouts of length n and turn proportion per length n, depending on the unique occurences of turns
in the transitions:

glm("turn transitions per length"~TimeFactor+Group+TimeFactor*Group+"total count of length n bouts"+"per length turn proportion/s", 
			family = quasipoisson)
