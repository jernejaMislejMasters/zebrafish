Husson, Lê and Pagès (2011). Exploratory Multivariate Analysis By Example Using R.

FactoMineR uses the square correlation ratios (which in curvilinear relationships are equal to the eta^2 values) to plot the variables.

When interpreting the biplot, the greater the perpendicular distance from the axis to the point, the stronger the correlation between the axis and the point.

Also the cosine of the angular distance between any two variables indicates the magnitude of correlation between them. You have to do a similar analysis on categories to gain insight into the direction of effect.
