 Between subject variation in the mixed effects model is examined in different drugs and drug dosages in healthy and disease induced larvae, while the within subject variation is examined in measurement time.

(I)Comparing the proportions of length 2 bout count of the hypoactive control assay, the 10 $\mu$M Haloperidol in healthy assay, and the 10 $\mu$M Haloperidol in hypoactive assay to the proportions of length 2 bout count in the healthy control assay.

First and seconf were plotted by color coding according to the different conditions, dosages and time progress.

 is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the input data correlation matrix
