 Between subject variation in the mixed effects model is examined in different drugs and drug dosages in healthy and disease induced larvae, while the within subject variation is examined in measurement time.

(I)Comparing the proportions of length 2 bout count of the hypoactive control assay, the 10 $\mu$M Haloperidol in healthy assay, and the 10 $\mu$M Haloperidol in hypoactive assay to the proportions of length 2 bout count in the healthy control assay.

First and seconf were plotted by color coding according to the different conditions, dosages and time progress.

 is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the input data correlation matrix

PCA results were additionally summarized and plotted with respect to the direction of change in time or of change in dosage. With respect to the direction of change in time, a vector was drawn from the first to the last timeframe, for all compounds and plotted together with the healthy control and the disease induced control, for each of the three different dosages. With respect to the change in dosage, an average was taken over all thirteen timeframes and a curved vector was drawn over all three averages of the three different dosages, for all compounds and plotted together with the two controls, also averaged in time.
